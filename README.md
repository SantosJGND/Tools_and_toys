# Tools and Toys

In the course of my work i have come to rely on or identify some blocks of code that
proved to be of particular use. Some of this code was conceptually or structurally
sufficiently complicated to warrant several modules and a framework of application.

This repository was created with the view in mind of sharing those blocks of code.
In doing this it has served another purpose, that of disciplining myself to render 
my code more accessible to others. Each tool or package is accompanied with
a jupyter notebook to serve as tutorial.

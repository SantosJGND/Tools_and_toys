### Music sampler

This repository stores code to produce sound samples from genomic variance in .vcf files.

The sound samples are simple. Only the amplitude is a function of local variance. 

The [Genome Sampler](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SantosJGND/Tools_and_toys/blob/master/Music/Genome_sampling.ipynb) notebook provides a extention on this effort. 

I tried to use sound samples produced from genetic data to reproduce a song. 

The final contribution of genetic data to the sound produce is actually minimal, but it was an interesting exercise and
the result is satisfactory (for very clean, very short samples).
